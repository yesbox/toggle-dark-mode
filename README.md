# Toggle Dark Mode
Quickly toggle between light and dark mode on Windows with a simple utility.

I could not find a built-in way to quickly toggling the light/dark mode on Windows 11. The Settings utility is too clumsy for switching multiple times per day, depending on the weather and lighting conditions.

## Usage
The utility switches to the light or dark mode that you are currently not using. There is no user interface and the utility will exit immediately after switching mode.

If you create a shortcut to the program on your Desktop, then under Properties and Shortcut, you may set a Shortcut key, such as Ctrl-Alt-D. You could also just put it on your Taskbar or in the Start Menu and click it.

An option can be given to switch to a specific mode instead of toggling if desired:
```
-l, --light: Set light mode.
-d, --dark:  Set dark mode.
-h, --help:  Show help message.
```
